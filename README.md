## Cardano-Powered Community Impact Verification System

## Problem Statement

* Unverifiable environmental impact - No reliable way to prove community actions
* Unsustainable volunteer efforts - Lack of incentives for continued participation
* Broken recycling supply chains - Inefficient material collection and processing
* Fragmented community data - Scattered, unreliable impact reporting
* No on-chain environmental footprint tracking - Traditional systems lack transparency

## Solution

A decentralized platform where community environmental actions are crowdsource-verified and anchored on Cardano's blockchain, with tokenized rewards for contributors. We replace traditional reporting with community-sourced verification and immutable on-chain proof.

## How It Works

**1. Action Capture**  
Community members log environmental actions via mobile app with photo and GPS verification

**2. Community Verification**  
Multiple validators review and confirm each action through reputation-based system

**3. On-Chain Proof**  
Verified actions generate immutable Cardano transactions with IPFS-stored evidence

**4. Tokenized Rewards**  
Contributors earn ADA or utility tokens for verified impact

**5. Recycling Pipeline**  
Sorted materials are directed to partner recyclers

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter for cross-platform mobile
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express
* **Blockchain:** Cardano (DIDs, native tokens, transaction metadata)
* **Storage:** IPFS for proof images and documents
* **Verification:** Reputation-based crowdsourced validation
