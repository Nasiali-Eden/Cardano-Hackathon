# City Watch (Impact Ledger) Information

## Summary
City Watch (also referred to as Impact Ledger) is a decentralized platform built with Flutter and anchored on the Cardano blockchain. It aims to verify community environmental actions (like recycling or environmental cleanup) through a crowdsourced, reputation-based system. The app features multi-role support for Organizations and Users/Volunteers, integrating with Firebase for authentication and data storage, and Google Maps for location-based services.

  - **Organization/**: UI and logic for organization-specific features (dashboards, team management, volunteer coordination).
  - **User/**: UI and logic for user/volunteer features (reporting incidents, reading articles, help center).
  - **Shared/**: Reusable screens and inputs (login, incident posting).
  - **Services/**: Backend service integrations (Firebase Auth, Firestore, Incident uploads).
  - **Models/**: Data models (User, etc.).
  - **Reusables/**: Shared UI components (buttons, input fields).
- **android/**: Android-specific configuration and native code (AGP 8.7.3, Kotlin 2.1.0).
- **ios/**: iOS-specific configuration and native code.
- **assets/ / images/ / pngs/**: Application assets including icons, logos, and map markers.
